    "# Week 6 Tuesday – Using nhanes survey data to examine the link between education and income\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will work with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (nhanes) data from the USA National Center for Health Statistics (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm). As preparation for today’s class, you already took a look at the data and explored the variables that will be used today. The objective of this activity is to practice the R coding skills you acquired over the last few weeks, and to prepare you for the midterm exam of coming Thursday. Therefore, try to work on this activity independently,\n",
    "save your script as a .R file and upload it to Canvas, export the graphs as .pdf files uploading them to Canvas as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity includes more questions than you are expected to be able to answer during class. The rest of the questions can be used for extra practice at home. A .html document with solutions to all questions will be available at the end of the day so you will be able to check your answers."

    "### Challenge: Use the Nhanes survey data to examine the relationship between income and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just started college. For many of you, the idea that a better education augments the probability of landing a good paying job will have played at least some role in your decision to go to college, apart from the obvious fact that Yale-NUS is such a great place to be spending the coming 4 years of your life. There are many studies that provide support for the notion that income and level of education are positively correlated. On the other hand, students are taking out more and more loans to finance their studies, which often turns out to be a significant long-term financial burden. In this challenge, we will explore the Nhanes survey data from 2000 and 2018 to see if we can find support for the idea that higher education increases the probability that you will earn more later in life."
